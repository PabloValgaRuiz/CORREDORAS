1. Results
   - Basa
      - Abundances
        - conditional:  $\delta^{13}C$
        - conditional:  $\delta^{13}C$ + multipliers
      - PAR
      (without
      lycopodium)
          - conditional:  $\delta^{13}C$
          - conditional:  $\delta^{13}C$ + multipliers
   - Garba Guracha
    (still not conditionals other than multipliers)

2. Sensitivity analysis
    - Bootstrap the multipliers
      - Same for all species
      - Different for all species
        (This probably does not achieve anything)
    - Normal/log normal noise
      - Same for all species
        - Multipliers as conditional
        - No conditionals
      - Different for all species
        (next section $\rightarrow$ residual-based bootstrapping)
3. Residual based bootstrapping
   (work in progress)
